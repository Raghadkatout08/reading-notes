## What is a serverless function?
[Serverless Functions](https://blog.hubspot.com/website/serverless-functions) are pieces of code that run in a serverless computing environment, where the cloud provider dynamically manages the allocation and provisioning of servers. Key points include:
- **Deployment architecture:** Serverless functions are deployed as individual units of code, with no need to manage servers or infrastructure.
- **Event-driven:** They are triggered by specific events, such as HTTP requests, database changes, or file uploads.
- **Scalability:** Serverless platforms automatically scale functions based on demand, ensuring optimal performance and cost efficiency.
- **Use cases:** Common use cases include API endpoints, background processing tasks, and real-time data processing.

## Pros and cons of serverless
The pros and cons of serverless computing are discussed in detail in [this IBM article](https://www.ibm.com/cloud/learn/serverless). Highlights include:
### Pros
- **Cost savings:** Serverless computing often results in lower costs compared to traditional server-based architectures, as users only pay for actual usage.
- **Scalability:** Serverless platforms automatically scale resources based on demand, allowing applications to handle spikes in traffic without manual intervention.
- **Developer productivity:** Serverless abstracts away infrastructure management, allowing developers to focus on writing code and delivering value to users.
### Cons
- **Cold start latency:** Serverless functions may experience latency when invoked for the first time, as the platform needs to initialize resources.
- **Vendor lock-in:** Adopting serverless platforms may lead to vendor lock-in, as migrating functions to another provider can be challenging due to proprietary APIs and services.
- **Monitoring and debugging:** Monitoring and debugging serverless applications can be more challenging compared to traditional architectures, as there are fewer visibility tools available.

## Create a Project and Deploy
[Create a Project and Deploy](https://vercel.com/docs/concepts/get-started/deploy) provides a step-by-step guide to getting started with Vercel. It covers:
- **Creating a new project:** How to start a new project from scratch or import an existing one.
- **Connecting a GitHub repository:** Seamless integration with GitHub for automatic deployments.
- **Configuring project settings:** Customize build settings, environment variables, and more.
- **Deploying the project to Vercel:** Deploy your project with a single click or command and see it live instantly.
- **Automatic scaling:** Your project automatically scales to handle traffic as it grows.

## http.server
[http.server](https://pymotw.com/3/http.server/index.html) is a module in Python that provides basic web server functionality. It allows you to:
- **Serve HTTP requests and responses:** Quickly set up a local server to serve files and handle HTTP requests.
- **Create simple web servers:** Ideal for development and testing without needing a full-fledged web server.
- **Understand HTTP communication:** Learn the basics of HTTP methods, headers, and status codes through practical examples.
- **Customization:** Extend the server functionality by overriding methods to handle specific types of requests.

## HTTP Request Methods
[HTTP Request Methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) documentation on MDN provides detailed information about the various HTTP methods, including:
- **GET:** Retrieve data from a server. Often used for fetching HTML pages, images, or other resources.
- **POST:** Send data to a server to create a new resource. Commonly used in form submissions.
- **PUT:** Update an existing resource on the server. Replaces the current representation with the payload.
- **DELETE:** Remove a resource from the server. Used to delete resources identified by a URI.
- **HEAD:** Similar to GET but only retrieves the headers. Used for checking resource availability or metadata.
- **OPTIONS:** Describe the communication options for the target resource. Used for CORS preflight requests.
- **PATCH:** Apply partial modifications to a resource. More efficient than PUT for small updates.

## Python & APIs
[Python & APIs](https://realpython.com/python-api/) on Real Python covers how to interact with web APIs using Python. Topics include:
- **Sending HTTP requests:** Using libraries like `requests` to send GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE requests.
- **Handling JSON data:** Parsing and constructing JSON payloads for API communication.
- **Authenticating with APIs:** Implementing authentication methods such as API keys, OAuth, and JWT.
- **Error handling:** Managing and debugging errors that arise during API interactions.
- **Practical examples:** Building applications that consume APIs, such as weather apps, data dashboards, and more.

## Videos

### What is Serverless?
[What is Serverless?](https://youtu.be/vxJobGtqKVM) is a video explaining the concept of serverless computing. It covers:
- **Basics of serverless architecture:** Understanding what serverless means and how it differs from traditional server-based computing.
- **Benefits:** Discusses cost-efficiency, scalability, and reduced operational complexity.
- **Common use cases:** Real-world examples of serverless applications, such as chatbots, data processing pipelines, and event-driven applications.
- **Popular serverless platforms:** Overview of services like AWS Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, and Azure Functions.

### HTTP Request and Response
[HTTP Request and Response](https://youtu.be/DrI2lUXL1no) is a video that provides an overview of the HTTP protocol. It explains:
- **Structure of HTTP requests and responses:** Components like request methods, URLs, headers, and body.
