# Summary: Data Structures and Linked Lists

## Data Structures Overview:

### Definition:
Data structures are efficient ways of organizing and storing data.

### Importance:
They enable efficient data management, organization, and algorithm optimization.

### Classification:
- Linear (e.g., arrays, linked lists, queues)
- Non-Linear (e.g., trees, graphs, hash tables)

### Applications:
Widely used in database management, operating systems, AI, etc.

### Popular Data Structures:
- Arrays
- Linked lists
- Trees
- Graphs
- Queues
- Stacks

### Advanced Structures:
- Segment trees
- Tries
- Suffix trees
- AVL trees

## Linked Lists Overview:

### Definition:
Linear data structure where elements are linked using pointers.

### Node Structure:
Each node contains data and a pointer to the next node.

### Purpose:
Offers dynamic memory allocation and efficient insertion/deletion.

### Types:
- Single-linked list
- Double-linked list
- Circular linked list

### Operations:
- Insertion
- Deletion
- Searching

### Advantages:
- Dynamic size
- Efficient insertion/deletion
- Flexibility

### Disadvantages:
- Lack of random access
- Memory overhead
