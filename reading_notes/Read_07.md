# Introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

This repository contains reading materials and additional resources for learning about Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts and Pytest fixtures and coverage.

## Classes and Objects:

- **Introduction to OOP:** Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm centered around "objects," which are instances of classes. OOP emphasizes structuring code into classes and objects, promoting modularity, reusability, and maintainability. Key OOP principles include encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.

  
- **Classes and Objects:** Objects encapsulate variables and functions into a unified entity, inheriting these from classes that serve as blueprints for object creation. The section introduces a basic class example, illustrating class definition with variables and functions. It explains object instantiation from classes and accessing object attributes and methods using dot notation.

Additionally, the __init__() function is introduced, serving as a special method called upon class instantiation for initializing class attributes.


## Pytest Fixtures and Coverage:

- Pytest fixtures offer a means to establish consistent test contexts, enabling the setup of test data or environment configurations. These fixtures, decorated with @pytest.fixture, are accessible to test functions. Pytest also supports code coverage analysis, aiding in evaluating test comprehensiveness by identifying executed code segments.
