Cryptography

### 1. Cryptography (TechTarget)

- **Summary**:
  - Cryptography secures communication and data by converting plaintext into ciphertext through encryption and back via decryption using keys.
  - Symmetric encryption uses the same key for both encryption and decryption (e.g., AES), while asymmetric encryption uses different keys (e.g., RSA).
  - Techniques ensure data confidentiality, integrity, authentication, and non-repudiation.

- **Summary**:
  - Essential concepts for developers:
    - **Symmetric Encryption**: Uses a single key for encryption and decryption.
    - **Asymmetric Encryption**: Utilizes public and private key pairs.
    - **Digital Signatures**: Verifies the authenticity and integrity of messages.
    - **Key Exchange Algorithms**: Safely exchange keys over insecure channels.
    - **Cryptographic Salts**: Add random data to hashed passwords for additional security.
    - **Initialization Vectors (IVs)**: Enhance encryption by introducing randomness.
    - **Cryptographic Nonces**: Unique numbers used once to prevent replay attacks.

- **Summary**:
  - Hashing transforms data into fixed-size hash values (hash codes or digest) using hash functions.
  - **Properties**:
    - **Deterministic**: Same input always produces the same hash output.
    - **Uniqueness**: Different inputs ideally produce unique hash outputs.
    - **Collision Resistance**: Difficult to find two different inputs with the same hash output.
  - **Common Hash Algorithms**: MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256 are widely used for different security requirements.
