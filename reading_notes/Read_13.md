# Linear Regression in Machin Learning

## Linear Regression

**Definition**: Linear regression is a statistical technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables. Both GeeksforGeeks and Real Python provide comprehensive guides on the theory and practical implementation of linear regression, primarily using Python.


### Simple Linear Regression
- **Equation**: \( y = mx + c \)
- **Variables**: One independent variable \( x \)
- **Coefficients**: \( m \) (slope), \( c \) (intercept)

### Multiple Linear Regression
- **Equation**: \( y = b_0 + b_1x_1 + b_2x_2 + \ldots + b_nx_n \)
- **Variables**: Multiple independent variables \( x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n \)
- **Coefficients**: \( b_0 \) (intercept), \( b_1, b_2, \ldots, b_n \) (slopes)


## Objective
The goal of linear regression is to minimize the sum of the squared differences between observed values and predicted values using the least squares method.

## Assumptions
1. **Linearity**: The relationship between dependent and independent variables is linear.
2. **Independence**: Observations are independent of each other.
3. **Homoscedasticity**: Constant variance of the error terms.
4. **Normality**: Error terms are normally distributed.

## Steps Involved

1. **Data Collection**: Gather data containing the dependent and independent variables.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Clean the data, handle missing values, and split into training and test sets.
3. **Model Training**: Fit the linear model using the training data.
4. **Prediction**: Use the model to predict outcomes for new data.
5. **Evaluation**: Use metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared to evaluate the model's performance.

# Applications

- **Trend Prediction:** Forecasting future values based on past trends.
- **Risk Management:** Analyzing financial risk.
- **Healthcare:** Predicting medical outcomes.

# Conclusion

Linear regression is a foundational technique in machine learning and statistics, widely used for predictive analysis. Both GeeksforGeeks and Real Python provide valuable insights into the theory and practical implementation of linear regression in Python.
